Ubuntu experiences:

- Change lock screen: /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf ( you may need to change some other files because it bases on them)

- Change splash screen : /usr/share/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth. Plymouth control your screen when you start your computer.

I have written a long story about how I fixed my computer when it contained three desktop environments : Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu which I had set up chronologically (I really messed up my computer.I finally decided to use Lubuntu but my lock screen is Ubuntu, and the splash screen is Xubuntu. It really wasted a lot of time to fix. I even tried to use "find" command to delete all xfce4 or xubuntu ... ). But my story has been disappeared since my stupid and wrong Ctrl + C :) .
